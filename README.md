# Pokemon Stats Clustering

This project applies agglomerative clustering to group Pokemon based on their Attack and HP stats.

## Overview

This data science project aims to discover meaningful clusters among Pokemon using their Attack and HP statistics. By employing agglomerative clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, we can identify groups of Pokemon with similar characteristics in these two key attributes.

## Features

- Data preprocessing of Pokemon statistics
- Implementation of agglomerative clustering algorithm
- Visualization of clusters using scatter plots
- Analysis of cluster characteristics and compositions

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing various Pokemon statistics, focusing primarily on the Attack and HP attributes for clustering purposes.
Here's the [Pokemon_Stats Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b8MlRCUHI-9NQ__9VCSu9qJJTjjlKocW?usp=sharing) and [Pokemon Images Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17a1cY3gsQEZilRz00czq6GtanxFHksQV?usp=sharing) from [G-drive]. It includes various attributes of Pokemon, with a focus on Attack and HP for this clustering analysis.

## Methodology

1. Data cleaning and normalization
2. Feature selection (Attack and HP)
3. Application of agglomerative clustering
4. Determination of optimal number of clusters
5. Visualization of results
6. Interpretation of cluster meanings

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsmarmot/Pokemon-Clustering.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Pokemon-Clustering
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the project script:
    ```bash
    python cluster_pokemon.py
    ```

## Results

[Brief description of findings or link to results]

## Future Work (Suggestion)

- Incorporate additional Pokemon attributes for more complex clustering
- Compare results with other clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN)
- Develop a recommendation system based on cluster analysis
